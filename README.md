# Nickname Generator

### Working


This generator works by randomly selecting vowels and consonants to put them into a new word, a "nickname". I'll explain this better later.

Of course, some of them suck and no one would want to use them as a pseudonym. But some are pretty good and can be a good nickname!

Maybe you would prefer an example ^^:

Here are the vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y.

And here are the consonants: b, c, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, x, z.

I want a nickname that is built like this: vowel, consonant, vowel, vowel, consonnant, vowel.


The generator takes random vowels and consonants, adds them together in the asked order. The obtained nickname is maybe "Acoony", or "Oneyji" !


### Usage

* To get 4 new nicknames, click on the "AGAIN!" button at the middle.
* To enable or disable the blurring on nicknames, click on the switch below the button.
* To see all generated nicknames, click on the "History" button.
* Right click on a nickname to reverse it, left click to shuffle the letters.

##### Keyboard shortcuts

* `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `G` to generate 4 new nicknames.
* `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `F` to manage the blurring.
* `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `H` to show or hide the history.
